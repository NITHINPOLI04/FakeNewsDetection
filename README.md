# FakeNewsDetection
To detect fake news articles from the given dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The process involves text preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and training classification models to achieve reliable predictions.

## Features
Text preprocessing using regex.<br>
Feature extraction with TF-IDF.<br>
Handling imbalanced datasets with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).<br>
Training and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest).<br>
Visualization of performance metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curves, etc.).<br>

## Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.<br>
scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks and evaluations.<br>
imbalanced-learn (imblearn): For handling class imbalances.<br>
pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.<br>
matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizations.<br>
